 
Questions:  Impacts of the Global Economy  (why corporations/banks have gone  global, benefits for periphery/semi -periphery countries when  multinational companies have manufacturing there, benefits for lending  $ to periphery countries to aid their development ) 


Labor tends to be far less expensive in countries in the periphery than in core countries. Corporations that operate in countries other than the ones in which they are headquartered are sources of funds for peripherals. The loans increase prosperity and promote development due to poorer countries being able to repay other debts. Thereby increasing the world’s overall economy.



  Case Study on page 553. The Financial Crisis of 2007 -2008. Explain how  the financial crisis was an indication of globalization.  


The great recession displays globalization because an economic problem in the United States ruined most global markets due to the US’s major role in them.



  Looking at the map on page 554, explain what might have caused countries in  Africa to be spared the worst of the Great Recession. Remember what you have  learned so far about globalization and interconnectivity.  


Countries in Africa were less affected by the Great Recession due to them being less economically connected to the rest of the world.



  Changes in the Economic Landscape (just -in-time deliveries, Fordism  and mass production, post -Fordism, how is current car manufacturing  an example of post -Fordism)  


Computerized logistics systems facilitate justintime delivery of raw materials. Fordism focuses on automation and a division of labor.  PostFordism is used to describe automation through the use of computer systems. Ex: Amazon.



  Outsourcing (offshore outsourcing, why call centers in India, NIKE in Vietnam)  


Moving production outside the country is referred to as offshore outsourcing. People speak English at higher rates in India. Nike uses cheap labor in Vietnam.



  Division of Labor (international division of labor, shoes made in Vietnam, China  and technology, North/South divide of the international division of labor, low  wages, multiplier effects)  


Core countries made an international division of labor. Rare earth metals are in China, making it good for technology. Multiplier effects describe how outsourcing fixed some LDCs.



 1. Compare the goals of Fordism and post -Fordism  


Fordism aims to make human workers efficient. PostFordism seeks to replace human labor with computers.



 2. Explain the degree to which outsourcing helps and hinders peripheral and  semi -peripheral countries.  


Outsourcing helps LDC by providing economic opportunity. But hinders by providing unfair working conditions and pay.



     New Manufacturing Zones  


Industry growth created new manufacturing zones to attract investment.



  Special Economic Zones (define it, benefit for companies, where are they, China,  Philippines, India, Central and South America)  


 A special economic zone is more beneficial for regulations.  Receive tax incentives and lower tariffs. China, India, and South America have seen great success.



  Export Processing Zones  (define it, difference from SEZs, Tanzania, northern  Mexico)  


 Export processing zones attract multinational organizations to invest in laborintensive assembly. Are smaller and have a narrower focus. Mexico uses to ship faster to the US.



  Free Trade Zones (define it, benefits of them, Hong Kong ) 


FTZs provide customsrelated advantages and exemptions from tariffs and taxes.  Hong Kong charges no tariffs on the import or export of goods; combined with its location and natural harbor, Hong Kong’s status as an FTZ has contributed to its success as a major port city.
